#(i)nfoBar - <em>The window to your future workplace</em>
##What is (i)nfoBar?
(i)nfoBar is an <em>online professional networking platform</em> where jobseekers can view the live broadcasts of a list of companies. It was an idea executed by 3 young female Computer Scientists-in-learning for our Systems Programming Course (CS252) at Purdue University, West Lafayette.

##Our Mission
Our mission for this platform was to provide the opportunity for <em>borderless, intimate</em> professional networking between employers and prospective employees. This mission is addressed by our proudest feature - the **live chatrooms**!

#Features
##Live Chatrooms
Companies can **create live chatrooms** by going to their profile pages. One a room is created, the room initiator (highlighted in red) is free to share his/her stories with guests joining in on the conversation. Oh, and there's a **live chatbox** too!

##Broadcast Notifications
When a company is holding a live broadcast, an **"Online"** button will appear on the company dashboard. Everyone is free to join the chatroom by clicking on the button.

##User Profiling
Companies are required to **register** at (i)nfoBar in order to begin hosting broadcasts. Account information is stored in MongoDB. Guests (jobseekers) are not required to register in order to use the platform.
